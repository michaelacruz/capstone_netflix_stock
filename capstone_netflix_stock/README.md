# Netflix Stock Capstone Project

This capstone project is part of the Codecademy's Data Science career path. I use stock data in 2017 to analyze the stock performance of Netflix (NFLX) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The project consists of using Python and some libraries (Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn) to create visualizations of the data.

The video.txt file contains a link to my YouTube video, where I discuss my analysis and code.

Enjoy, and thanks for watching.
